### I've made a tool that can turn Notion workspace into a chat
I've been playing with OpenAI's embedding api and decided to build a prototype around it.






Features:
Select which pages will be included/excluded  in import
NotionChat does not hallucinates responses. If it can't find answer to the question it will simply respond "I don't know".
Share chatbot with others


Process:
1. Add NotionChat integration to your workspace
2. Choose which pages will be imported
3. After few minutes you'll get access to the chatbot based on the imported pages
