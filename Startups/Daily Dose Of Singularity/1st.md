Hi! This is your daily dose of singularity.
Autogpt is GPT-4 running fully autonomously. It even has a voice, can fix code, set tasks, create new instances and more.

babyagi is a program that given a task, creates a task list and executes the tasks over and over again. Itâ€™s now been open sourced and is the top trending repos on Github at that moment.

Now you can have voice conversations with chatgpt. This twitter user created a chrome extension adding a new functionality to chagpt allowing you to record your messages with voice.
