If you ever used a calculator than you probably already have general understand of what programming is.
Consider what you're doing with calculator: you punch in numbers and mathematical operations (like addition "+", subtraction "-", multiplication "x", division "รท") and it gives you the result. Essentially, you're giving the calculator a sequence of commands to perform, and it follows those commands to produce an output.
Programming a computer is exactly like this. The main difference is that computer understands far more commands than calculator. In the same as math has certain language to express calculations, computers have programming language to express instructions that they should execute. 

### What programming consists of
When you're using a calculator you essentially do two things: 
1. You decide which numbers you want to include in calculation
2. You decide which mathematical operators to use and in which order they should be executed

If we would express this in programming terms we would say that numbers are data and mathematical formula is algorithm of your simple program that you put in the calculator.
Data and algorithms are the two main topics that you will be studying. Almost every piece of knowledge about programming that you'll see will be in some way tied either to data or to algorithms. So it's important to understand what it is.

#### Data
Data is information related to a problem you're trying to solve with programming but presented in form that can be understood by computer. Before writing any code you need answer several questions about data:
*What information my program needs?*
*What is structure and types of data I'm going to work with?*
*Where the data will be coming from?*

Imagine you want to write a program for you online store. You want it to take calculate how much money customers spent last month in each product category.
*What information my program needs?*
We need information about all products bought in the last month. More specifically we need to know value and category of each product. 


There are different types of data: numbers, texts, dates, etc. For a computer, it's important to know the type of particular piece of data because different information can be manipulated differently. You can add, divide, multiply or do any math operations with numbers, but not with text. On other hand you can split one text in two pieces but you can't do it with numbers. So apart from deciding what data you need for your program you also need to think about data types. 
For example, you want to automate sorting emails in you mailbox. Let's imagine you receive hundreds of emails per day for different purposes: personal, work, promotions, social media updates, etc. Sorting through all these manually can be time-consuming. Before writing any code you should think about what information your program will need to do the task. In this example, you'll need to know subject, contents, and sender email. 

Programming is a process of writing instructions that will be later executed by a computer. It's part of larger process called software development. Before starting programming you need to understand the problem(s) that you're trying to solve and how you are going to approach it. Each computer has a set of pre-programmed commands that it knows out of the box. The programmer's task is to combine these commands in such a way that final program solves the problem at hand.
